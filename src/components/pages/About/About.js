                            Mission-driven full stack developer with a passion for thoughtful UI design, collaboration,

                        I’ve always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me. Although my
                        professional path has taken many twists and turns — from touring and recording artist, to
                        employee of the year at a non-profit, to dean's scholar at UPenn, to small business owner and
                        entrepreneur — I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems.

                        As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for
                        making things, and my mission-driven work ethic to literally change the world. That's why I’m
                        excited to make a big impact at a high growth company.
